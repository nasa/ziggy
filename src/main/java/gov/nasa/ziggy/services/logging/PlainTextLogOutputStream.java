/**
 * Subclass of {@link LogOutputStream} used in the context of a {@link PumpStreamHandler} to capture
 * stdout / stderr from a {@link DefaultExecutor} and transfer it to the log file of the thread that
 * runs the {@link DefaultExecutor}.
 * <p>
 * The arguments to {{@link #processLine(String, int)} may come from the output of a process running
 * in the {@link DefaultExecutor} that doesn't prepend a timestamp to the message, or it might be a
 * log message from a Java class running inside the {@link DefaultExecutor}, in which case there
 * will be a prepended timestamp. The {{@link #processLine(String, int)} checks for the timestamp at
 * the start of a line; if the timestamp is present, the line is written as-is to stdout, if the
 * timestamp is absent, the line is written to the logger for the {@link PlainTextLogOutputStream}
 * class. In this way it is guaranteed that all output has one and only one timestamp prepended.
 * <p>
 * As the messages started out as stdout or stderr from the {@link DefaultExecutor} process, there
 * is no level information available, so all messages are written at info level.
