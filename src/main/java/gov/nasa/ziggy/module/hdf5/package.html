      Ziggy uses HDF5 as its interchange format for specifying inputs and outputs to
      algorithm processes. This package provides support for HDF5 communication.
      Arrays of primitives, Strings, and enums are managed by instances of
      PrimitiveHdf5Array. Arrays of more complex Java types are managed by 
      instances of PersistableHdf5Array. Pipeline module parameter sets are managed
      by ModuleParametersHdf5Array. An instance of PersistableHdf5Array can contain
      fields that are instances of PrimitiveHdf5Array, ModuleParametersHdf5Array, or
      PersistableHdf5Array instances. In this way, the full data hierarchy represented
      by a Java object can be translated to HDF5, and vice-versa.
