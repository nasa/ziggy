/**
 * Provides classes and interfaces for Ziggy operations on instrument models. Instrument models
 * generally represent information on the state of the instruments used to acquire the data
 * processed by Ziggy. Examples include calibration constants; values of position, velocity,
 * attitude, and/or pointing; descriptions of instrument geometry; etc. Ziggy provides version
 * control and data accountability for models used in data analysis.
