    Reporting tools for data accountability. Data accountability is the traceability
    between inputs and outputs, such that for any given output it is possible to 
    work backwards and find all data, models, and parameters that were inputs to
    the production of those outputs. Ziggy implements this by maintaining a database
    table of all data files in the datastore. Each file in the table
    has the ID of its producer (pipeline task that produced it) recorded, along with
    the IDs of all consumers of that file (pipeline tasks that used that file as
    an input).

    Data accountability for models uses a different mechanism, see the ModelRegistry
    class in gov.nasa.ziggy.models. Similarly, parameter set accountability uses 
    a system implemented in gov.nasa.ziggy.parameters.
