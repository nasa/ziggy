  <!-- Pipeline definition file for Ziggy sample pipeline. This is where it all comes
       together. Here we define the pipeline modules (the actual things that get
       executed), then the pipeline or pipelines. Each pipeline contains a sequence of
       nodes, where a node is a combination of a pipeline module, information about inputs
       and outputs, information about models, and parameter sets. Enjoy!
  -->

  <!-- Pipeline modules. The name of each module must correspond to the name of
       a program that can execute from the command line, and that program must be
       on the search path defined for the pipeline in the properties file.

  <!-- Here's the pipeline definition. Note that we could have defined multiple
       pipelines in this file, but this is just the simplest sample pipeline
       imaginable, hence only one pipeline definition.
