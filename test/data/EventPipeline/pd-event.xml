<!-- Pipeline definition file for Ziggy sample pipeline. This is where it all comes
     together. Here we define the pipeline modules (the actual things that get
     executed), then the pipeline or pipelines. Each pipeline contains a sequence of
     nodes, where a node is a combination of a pipeline module, information about inputs
     and outputs, information about models, and parameter sets. Enjoy!
-->

    <!-- Pipeline modules. The name of each module must correspond to the name of
         a program that can execute from the command line, and that program must be
         on the search path defined for the pipeline in the properties file.

    <!-- Here's the pipeline definition. Note that we could have defined multiple
         pipelines in this file, but this is just the simplest sample pipeline 
         imaginable, hence only one pipeline definition.
