## Using the Ziggy Console, Part 1

I ain't gonna lie to you: getting a full understanding of the Ziggy console is a tall order. For this reason, we've broken it down into several parts, and then broken those parts down into even smaller parts. Here in Part 1, we'll concentrate on things that are relevant to starting and running a pipeline under relatively normal circumstances.

As we go through it, we'll always use the sample pipeline to show what we're talking about in the most concrete way we can.

### [Starting a Pipeline](start-pipeline.md)

This is probably the first thing you want to do: see an actual pipeline run!

### [The Instances Panel](instances-panel.md)

Watch what Ziggyy is doing in real time.

### [Changing the Start and End Nodes](start-end-nodes.md)

There's no law that says you have to run the pipeline straight through from its first node to its last.

### [Changing Module Parameter Values](change-param-values.md)

How the user adjusts the user-adjustable parameters.

### [Organizing Pipelines and Parameter Sets](organizing-tables.md)

Bringing order to the chaos of some of the Ziggy display and edit tables. 

### [The Edit Pipeline Dialog Box](edit-pipeline.md)

How the user adjusts most parameters related to things like provisioning execution resources.

### [The Datastore Control Panel](datastore-regexp.md)

Adjust the regular expressions in your datastore definition.
