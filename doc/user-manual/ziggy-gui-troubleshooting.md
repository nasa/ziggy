Here are some articles on things you can use the Ziggy console for that relate to troubleshooting and recovery from problems.

### [Monitoring Tab](monitoring.md)

There's a whole bunch of stuff you can see on the Monitoring tab.

### [Alerts Panel](alerts.md)

When things happen that the operator should know about, they show up at the `Alerts` panel. 

### [Log Files Display](display-logs.md)

For any given task you can display the task's log files directly from the console.
