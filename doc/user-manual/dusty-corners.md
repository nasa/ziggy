## Ziggy's Dustier Corners

Like most software packages, Ziggy has some features that don't see a lot of use or that only get exercised under unusual circumstances. Those oddballs are documented here.

### [More on Parameter Sets](more-parameter-sets.md)

### [Parameter Overrides](parameter-overrides.md)

### [Redefining a Pipeline](redefine-pipeline.md)
