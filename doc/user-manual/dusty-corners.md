## Ziggy's Dustier Corners

Like most software packages, Ziggy has some features that don't see a lot of use or that only get exercised under unusual circumstances. Those oddballs are documented here.

### [More on the Relational Database](more-rdbms.md)

Techically the RDBMS is used all the time, but there are a few details about what we do with it that are potentially interesting to users.

### [More on Parameter Sets](more-parameter-sets.md)

Importing, modifying, version control, and more!

### [Parameter Overrides](parameter-overrides.md)

How to conveniently package a collection of parameter changes.

### [Redefining a Pipeline](redefine-pipeline.md)

What to do if you realize that you need to change the configuration of a pipeline.

### [The Edit Pipeline Dialog Box](edit-pipeline.md)

Additional features on a dialog box we've already used.

### [Creating Ziggy Nicknames](nicknames.md)

Make it easier to run those Java programs you've written.

<!--
### [Customizing Ziggy](customizing-ziggy.md)
