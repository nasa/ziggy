## Data Receipt

In [the article on pipeline definition](pipeline-definition.md), we mentioned that Ziggy has a special-purpose pipeline module, Data Receipt, that imports data and models into the datastore and which is the only pipeline module the user doesn't need to define. In [the article on starting a pipeline](start-pipeline.md), we led you through starting the sample pipeline, which starts with the data receipt module.

So far, so good. However, you've probably noticed that at no point have we told you enough about the details of data receipt for you to feel comfortable putting it into a pipeline of your own.

Let's fix that now.

### [Data Receipt Execution Flow](data-receipt-execution.md)

This article covers the details of manifests, validation, the data receipt directory, and much, much more.

### [Data Receipt Display](data-receipt-display)

Ziggy provides a panel on the console that shows all of data receipt's activities going back to the beginning of time.
